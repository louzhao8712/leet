"""
DFS topology sort
We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, 
we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
 In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We don’t print the vertex immediately, 
 we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices,
 then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack.
 Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
